/// An arbitrary controlled gate.
///
/// Given any gate, ControlledGate can add control qudits.
///
/// A controlled gate adds arbitrarily controls, and is generalized
/// for qudit or even mixed-qudit representation.
///
/// A controlled gate has a circuit structure as follows:
///
/// ```text
///     controls ----/----■----
///                       |
///                      .-.
///     targets  ----/---|G|---
///                      '-'
/// ```
///
/// Where $G$ is the gate being controlled.
///
/// To calculate the unitary for a controlled gate, given the unitary of
/// the gate being controlled, we can use the following equation:
///
/// $$U_{control} = P_i \otimes I + P_c \otimes G$$
///
/// Where $P_i$ is the projection matrix for the states that don't
/// activate the gate, $P_c$ is the projection matrix for the
/// states that do activate the gate, $I$ is the identity matrix
/// of dimension equal to the gate being controlled, and $G$ is
/// the unitary matrix of the gate being controlled.
///
/// In the simple case of a normal qubit CNOT ($G = X$), $P_i$ and $P_c$
/// are defined as follows:
///
/// $$
///     P_i = \ket{0}\bra{0}
///     P_c = \ket{1}\bra{1}
/// $$
///
/// This is because the $\ket{0}$ state is the state that doesn't
/// activate the gate, and the $\ket{1}$ state is the state that
/// does activate the gate.
///
/// We can also decide to invert this, and have the $\ket{0}$
/// state activate the gate, and the $\ket{1}$ state not activate
/// the gate. This is equivalent to swapping $P_i$ and $P_c$,
/// and usually drawn diagrammatically as follows:
///
/// ```text
///     controls ----/----□----
///                       |
///                      .-.
///     targets  ----/---|G|---
///                      '-'
/// ```
///
/// When we add more controls the projection matrices become more complex,
/// but the basic idea stays the same: we have a projection matrix for
/// the states that activate the gate, and a projection matrix for the
/// states that don't activate the gate. As in the case of a toffoli gate,
/// the projection matrices are defined as follows:
///
/// $$
///     P_i = \ket{00}\bra{00} + \ket{01}\bra{01} + \ket{10}\bra{10}
///     P_c = \ket{11}\bra{11}
/// $$
///
/// This is because the $\ket{00}$, $\ket{01}$, and
/// $\ket{10}$ states are the states that don't activate the
/// gate, and the $\ket{11}$ state is the state that does
/// activate the gate.
///
/// With qudits, we have more states and as such, more complex
/// projection matrices; however, the basic idea is the same.
/// For example, a qutrit controlled-not gate that is activated by
/// the $\ket{2}$ state and not activated by the $\ket{0}$
/// and $\ket{1}$ states is defined as follows:
///
/// $$
///     P_i = \ket{0}\bra{0} + \ket{1}\bra{1}
///     P_c = \ket{2}\bra{2}
/// $$
///
/// One interesting concept with qudits is that we can have multiple
/// active control levels. For example, a qutrit controlled-not gate that
/// is activated by the $\ket{1}$ and $\ket{2}$ states
/// and not activated by the $\ket{0}$ state is defined similarly
/// as follows:
///
/// $$
///     P_i = \ket{0}\bra{0}
///     P_c = \ket{1}\bra{1} + \ket{2}\bra{2}
/// $$
///
/// Note that we can always define $P_i$ simply from $P_c$:
///
/// $$P_i = I_p - P_c$$
///
/// Where $I_p$ is the identity matrix of dimension equal to the
/// dimension of the control qudits. This leaves us with out final
/// equation:
///
///
/// $$U_{control} = (I_p - P_c) \otimes I + P_c \otimes G$$
///
/// If, G is a unitary-valued function of real parameters, then the
/// gradient of the controlled gate simply discards the constant half
/// of the equation:
///
/// $$
///     \frac{\partial U_{control}}{\partial \theta} =
///         P_c \otimes \frac{\partial G}{\partial \theta}
/// $$
